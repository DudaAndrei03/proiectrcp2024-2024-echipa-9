# Server CoAP

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web
   transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
   (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.

   CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
   application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and
   resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and
   Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP
   for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements
   such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for
   constrained environments.

- UDP binding with optional reliability supporting unicast and multicast requests.

- Asynchronous message exchanges.

- Low header overhead and parsing complexity.

- URI and Content-type support.

- Simple proxy and caching capabilities.
